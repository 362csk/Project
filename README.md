# Login Dashboard (Demo)

This is a simple, self-contained login dashboard demo.

- Open `practice.html` in your browser to view the login page.
- Demo credentials: `user@example.com` / `password`
- Successful login shows a small dashboard panel and stores a mock session in `localStorage`.

Files added:

- `practice.html` — main UI
- `styles.css` — styles and responsive layout
- `script.js` — minimal client-side logic (mock auth)

Notes:

- This is a front-end demo only. Do not use this code for real authentication.
- To reset the demo session, sign out or clear site storage in your browser.
